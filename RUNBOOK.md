Step-by-step documentation of everything executed on the server.

## 2026-08-22 — Server access verification
- Verified SSH access to 92.5.91.195 as user `ubuntu`.
- Collected system info: aarch64 (ARM64), Ubuntu 22.04 (Oracle Cloud), 4 vCPUs, 23Gi RAM, 146G disk (144G free).

## 2026-08-22 — GitHub SSH key setup
- Generated ed25519 key on server: `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/github_frappe_agent` (comment: frappe-k3s-agent, no passphrase).
- Public key added to GitHub account `ahmed3majeed` (done manually by user).
- Created `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/config` with a `Host github.com` entry pointing to the new key.
- Verified with `ssh -T git@github.com` → "Hi ahmed3majeed! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." (exit code 1 is expected for -T).

## 2026-08-22 — Repository creation
- Created public repo `ahmed3majeed/frappe-k3s-agent` via the GitHub REST API (`POST /user/repos`), authenticated with a short-lived Personal Access Token (ghp_***REDACTED***).
- API call was run on the local operator machine only — the PAT was never copied to or stored on this server.
- Response: HTTP 201, `html_url: https://github.com/ahmed3majeed/frappe-k3s-agent`, `ssh_url: git@github.com:ahmed3majeed/frappe-k3s-agent.git`, default branch `main`.
- Initialized local repo at `/home/ubuntu/frappe-k3s-agent`, added README.md, CHANGELOG.md, RUNBOOK.md.
- Pushed to GitHub over SSH using the `github_frappe_agent` deploy key configured above (no token involved in the push).

## 2026-08-22 — Phase 1: System Update

### Commands
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl wget git vim htop unzip \
  build-essential apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates gnupg2 software-properties-common \
  net-tools ufw
```

### Results
- `apt update`: package lists refreshed, 74 packages had upgrades available.
- `apt upgrade -y`: all 74 packages upgraded successfully.
  - **Note:** a kernel upgrade is pending — running kernel is `6.8.0-1054-oracle`, expected `6.8.0-1059-oracle` after upgrade. A reboot is required to load the new kernel; not performed automatically (would cause downtime). Flagged for a scheduled maintenance window.
- `apt install -y <essential packages>`: all requested packages already present/installed cleanly (no changes needed beyond the upgrade above).
